          About Me Hi there! I’m a passionate web developer who loves building
          clean, functional, and user-friendly applications. I enjoy learning
          new technologies and constantly challenging myself with new projects.
          Whether it’s front-end design or back-end logic, I find joy in turning
          ideas into reality through code. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably
          find me reading, sketching, or exploring new music. I believe in
          continuous growth, collaboration, and creating things that make
          people’s lives a little better. Thanks for stopping by!
